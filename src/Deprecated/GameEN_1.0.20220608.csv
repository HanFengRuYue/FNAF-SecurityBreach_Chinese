Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_1_7139,"(Audio Tape 1-7139) Hello, Vanessa. How are you feeling today? You look a little tired. Hmm... Well, it's been a while since we last spoke. How's your anxiety been? You did so well with your calming protocols when we first worked together. Are you still using those? Yes? Ok, good. Well, now I understand there's a new issue. It came on just recently? Rather suddenly? Can you tell me about it? <i>What issue? I've been doing my job. I come in and sit and my desk and do my work.</> Yes, yes of course you do. Your performance reviews are good, but a routine check of your online history has revealed that you've spent quite a bit of time with someone in an encrypted conversation. We have transcripts and I've read them, but it's not clear what you're talking about in these conversations. I can't make sense of it. You must be getting something from these that I'm not getting, right? Who are you talking to in these? <i>No one! Sometimes I talk with Luis, he's in the marketing department. He's nice, I guess.</> Yes, I see Luis here, but there's someone else.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_10_7144,"(Audio Tape 10-7144) I'd say make yourself comfortable, but I think you already are. It looks like you could take a nap. That's a nice chair, isn't it? According to these message logs, you've been working pretty late over the last couple of weeks... Or not working. Are you ready to talk about who you're interacting with? From what I can see here the interaction is getting more serious. Is it distracting you from your work? <i>My work is important. There's a non-disclosure agreement.</>",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_11_7145,"(Audio Tape 11-7145) Good morning, Vanessa. Well, I can't blame you for looking out the window instead of listening to me. It's a gorgeous day, isn't it? <i>I like the blue sky.</> Hmm, so do I. Now, let's see what we can get done on this nice sunny day. Ok, here we go. I know part of your job requires you to do online searches, but a routine audit of your search history has revealed that you're doing a little private searching on company time. Is that right? <i>I get breaks.</> That's true. So, on your breaks it looks like you were shopping for a costume. You purchased some fake fur material. What are you going to make? <i>(Indistinct muttering)</> What was that? Did you say the costume is a secret? Why is that? <i>I can't talk about this. He said he would always be watching.</> <i>He could be here or there or anywhere in-between.</> Are you talking about your dad? Have those feelings come up again? I hate sounding like a broken record, but this is something you really need to resolve if you're ever going to be happy. <i>I have! I compartmentalized him. He's locked away.</> No, that's not what I mean. You can't just ignore an issue. You have to face your memory of the experiences and process them so you can let it go. So you don't get triggered anymore. You can use a sort of self-dialogue to release these things. <i>I don't like doing that.</> Hmm, well, ok. We'll get back to that. I'd really like to know something about this costume. What's it for?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_12_7146,"(Audio Tape 12-7146) I understand you'll be transferring to a different location soon. I'll be sorry to see you go. I think we've been making progress, don't you? You can request to come back and speak with me more on your own time though. Did you know that? Our sessions don't have to be company mandated. I have all sorts of clients, Vanessa. I don't just work with corporations. I work with individuals and small groups, I even work in schools. I'm wherever I'm needed. <i>I'm needed somewhere else now. Thank you.</>",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_13_4676,"(Audio Tape 13-4676) When I'm getting to know a new client, I like to start by finding out directly from them what they like to do. How do you spend all the time you have? Nothing? Well... how do you feel about sports? You like sports? Yeah? No? Oh, I get it. You like to watch them, but not play them. You like being inside, don't you? I get that. Lots of weird stuff outdoors, isn't there? Yeah, I understand. Well, I hate to do this right off the bat, but I've been directed to ask you about this. Apparently, I'm the fourth therapist you've had, and apparently all three of your former therapists have gone missing. Or, two of them are missing. I don't want to scare you, but I have to tell you that one of them was found dead. That doesn't seem to upset you. Well then, I guess I'll go ahead and tell you that the woman's body was pretty messed up. It looked like it was mangled by machinery. That doesn't bother you either? Hmm... it's all pretty strange, I think. I'm not clear on the circumstances. Apparently, the police don't have any evidence. How does all of this make you feel? Chuckles) Maybe I should be watching my back. Yeah, that's funny, isn't it? Ok, shall we move on to something lighter?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_14_4677,"(Audio Tape 14-4677) Do you know a place called Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex? I'll take your silence as a yes. And besides, I know you know it. Because the technicians who work for Pizzaplex know you. Or rather, I guess it would be better to say that they think they do. They report that they have caught you on camera, or at least it appears to be you. Nothing to say about that? Well, the techs are convinced that you've hacked into their system many times. Although, I'll admit I don't see any proof here. Seems like they have more of a gut feeling than fact. But apparently the hacks are causing all kinds of problems. Hmm, you get a kick out of that? The idea of techs running around like chickens with their heads cut off? Yeah, that's a funny image, isn't it? But seriously, I have to say that I think it's weird that you'd spend so much time in such a busy, social place. You seem like more of a loner to me. Lots of time by yourself instead of with friends. Lots of time talking to yourself, right? Is it the electronics you like? I saw in your file that you've developed software programs that talk to you and repeat phrases, right? The program asks you questions and prompts you for responses. It's kind of like your own self therapy, isn't it? Another way of talking to yourself to work things out, right? When I saw some of your recent encrypted conversation logs, that's what I thought I was looking at. It felt like I was watching someone go back and forth in their own head, but the techs found something that's different than that. When I read what they found, at first, I thought I was looking at more examples of you just talking with yourself, then I realized it was different. When I study this, it sounds like there is someone else responding to you. Who is it?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_15_4678,"(Audio Tape 15-4678) I saw some ink blot test results in your file. I like ink blot tests. You wanna do one? Yes? Ok. How about this one? What do you see? What? You wanna hold it? Ok. You think it's a mask? It reminds you of a mask? Like a disguise? Yeah, I can see that. You like the idea of being disguised? Disguises let you be sort of invisible, don't they? You can get away with almost anything when you're invisible, can't you? (chuckles). Yeah? You like that idea, huh? Well ok, moving on. I have another report we need to talk about. Apparently, the techs were reviewing communications going in and out of this building and they came across some interesting things. They say you're in communication with someone... or maybe something. Pretty strange. What do you think about that? Nothing? Well, the techs say it looked to them like it was an attempt to manipulate you, or maybe to lure you somewhere. There, that's better. On this side of the desk, I can see your eyes. The thing is, when I read the communications, I get something different out of them. I don't think you're being manipulated here. I think you're the one doing the manipulating. No comment, huh? Ok... then how about this? I have this still shot the techs pulled from the security footage that recorded you in the Pizzaplex. That's you, isn't it? I know this image is distorted, but I think it looks like you. And you're not alone here. You're talking to someone, or something, it's hard to tell. What are those things? They almost look like rabbit ears. What? You find that amusing? Well, I guess it is.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_16_4679,"(Audio Tape 16-4679) I got another message from the techs at the Pizzaplex. I'm afraid it's about you again. The techs have been struggling to fix some serious glitches with the robots. I'm not sure what exactly is wrong except that it's making the robots more eerie than entertaining. You like that? Eerie instead of entertaining? Thanks, but it's really not that funny. Apparently, the glitch extended beyond the robots. It went system wide. It began infecting all the machines and when the techs traced the glitch back to its origin it led them to you. And I'm not going to pretend to understand everything I'm reading here, but what I get is that the system wide glitch was like a cascade that was broadcasting a very dangerous message. While the techs were trying to reprogram the system to remove the glitch, the source of the glitch shifted. You'll have to excuse me, I'm not all that familiar with computer programming so I might get this wrong, but what I understand is that the glitch stopped being a glitch and turned into an intentional set of sub-routines that were aimed at creating the same thing the glitch created. Those sub-routines seem to have come from you. Can you explain that? Listen, I'm on your side here. Our sessions are just between you and me. The techs can't prove what they think, so you're not in trouble. I just thought you could tell me what you're trying to do. Maybe if we could get to the bottom of that it could help you. What do you think? Still not talking? Alright, well then let's do this. Why don't we talk about the research I did in your past, shall we? Some therapists think they should only focus on information they get from their clients, but some therapists, like me, think it's helpful to find out about clients from other sources. Wanna guess what I found out when I looked into the tragedy of your past? All that stuff about your parents? You aren't even gonna look at me? Fine, you can look at the floor all you want, but it won't change the fact that none of what you said in your file about your parents was true. The truth is, you had great parents, a great childhood. Why did you lie? Look at me. Tell me why you lied. You - (clears throat) Well, I can understand why you might feel angry about the way I just confronted you. Why don't we come back to this another day? You're shaking your head as though that's not going to happen.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_2_4672,"(Audio Tape 2-4672) Good morning. Isn't it a pretty day? No? What's the matter? Oh, right, too bright. I'll pull the shades. Better? When the shade's pulled it feels like we're in a cubby hole or a cave, yeah? Hmm... so you're not talking to me again today? (Sigh) This isn't all that productive, you know? Don't you think these sessions are more successful when you talk to me? You know everyone associated with this company gets performance reviews, right? When my sessions don't get results my reviews aren't very good. If you don't wanna talk for your own sake, how about for mine? You don't want me to get in trouble, do you? I could be put in the corner for a timeout. Yeah, you think that's funny, huh?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_3_7140,"(Audio Tape 3-7140) Hi. Go ahead, sit down. <i>I don't know you. What happened to...</> Oh, we'll get to know each other in no time. I've read through all your files so I feel like we've been talking for weeks. I feel like I know your dad too. Bill, right? Your dad's name was Bill? <i>(Indistinct muttering)</> I'm sorry, what did you say? <i>I try to do what I'm supposed to do.</> I know you do. Your supervisor notes that you follow instructions perfectly. Your dad made you follow instructions, didn't he? I'm talking about the custody battle between your mom and your dad. Your dad didn't play fair, did he? He used to make your mom look bad in court. I'm so sorry that happened to you. Do you want to talk about how that felt? I suppose I don't need you to tell me it felt bad to have a parent scare you into saying things that weren't true. He manipulated you. It wasn't your fault. It's really sad, but it's common for one parent to use their child to hurt the other parent. I know your mom (STATIC) after she lost the custody case. <i>I was supposed to be a good girl.</> What happened to her had nothing to do with you even though it was your testimony that did it. Was that testimony true? No. I didn't think so, but your dad is to blame, not you.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_4_4673,"(Audio Tape 4-4673) You're not going to talk to me? No? What's the problem? Oh, the flowers? Yes, these are particularly fragrant today, aren't they? I'll move them. There. Now, let's see. What are you looking at? You're amazingly alert, aren't you? Alright, well I'd like to have you tell me about yourself, but I can see that you're not going to do that, or are you? Alright then, if you aren't going to talk to me I'll just go by these notes. You just sit there and be comfy. Or not. That chair doesn't really fit you, does it? Well, this won't take long. Let's see, your previous counselor is no longer available. Does that bother you? No? You don't look surprised to see me sitting here instead of your last therapist. Well then, let's get to it. I'll admit that some of what's in your file is a little surprising. Overall, you don't come across as a troublemaker, but if you read between the lines it's clear that you have a little rebellious side, right? And I'm surprised by your knowledge of computers. You're something of a phenom. Do you know what that word means? It means you have unusual skill, like a hacker. I assume you know what a hacker is, yes? Do you think of yourself as a hacker?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_5_7141,"(Audio Tape 5-7141) Good morning, Vanessa. Let's jump right in, shall we? I got a message last night about you and I have to be honest it was upsetting. Apparently, the IT department has put together a pretty lengthy report chronicling non-job related communications that have been coming to your computer. The fact that you're still doing something obviously not work related on the job is disturbing enough, but what bothers me about what I read is that the messages you're getting seem very manipulative in nature. Do you know who I'm talking about? <i>I get a lot of messages from friends. I like when Luis writes to me, he's funny.</> I'm not talking about Luis. You know who I'm talking about. Why won't you open up about it? (Sigh) What you might not know is that this person who's been sending you messages has been hacking into your personal files too. These are the same files I have here. These files are full of details about your life. Do you know what that means? <i>I'm not in the tech department, I just type on the computers.</> I know that, but what matters here is that this person who is contacting you knows a lot about you. <i>Lots of people know more than I do. Sometimes I need to listen.</>",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_6_4674,"(Audio Tape 6-4674) Good morning! It's good to meet you! I've read your files, so I'm up to speed on what you and your previous therapists have worked on. Sure, you can have a candy. I'll have one too. You look chill sitting there like that. Not a care in the world, huh? Alright, well I'd like to start with talking about your parents. What happened to them, and you, was tragic, but when I looked through the notes I didn't get a sense that you've processed that emotionally. When I read your account of what happened it came across as, well, more of an objective rather than a subjective narrative. Oh, sorry, you don't know what that means, do you? What I mean is that the way you told the story is more like you were reading something from a book than you were talking about your own past. That makes me think you've cut yourself off from it, is that right? Not sure? Well, I see it in your file that you spend a lot of time by yourself and are good at self-dialogue, you know what I mean? Asking yourself questions and getting answers? So, maybe you should ask yourself how you really feel about your past. Maybe you should give yourself a chance to really look at what happened and let yourself be upset about it. So you can let it go.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_7_7142,"(Audio Tape 7-7142) Hi, Vanessa. Would you like a candy? Butterscotch today. <i>No, thank you. Those have 35 calories a piece.</> Hmm, well they taste good to me! Ok, I thought we could do something today that will help us get to know one another better. It looks like you've never taken an ink blot test, right? No? Ok. Then I'm going to show you some ink blots like this one and I want you to tell me the first thing it makes you think of. Here we go. What do you see here? <i>A treehouse.</> Hmm, it does look sort of like a treehouse, doesn't it? Do you like treehouses? <i>I like to sit outside and read.</> That's good. Now, what about this one? <i>A beetle.</> Really? Looks like a face to me. That's very interesting.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_8_4675,"(Audio Tape 8-4675) Have you thought more about what we talked about? In our last session you told me you were sad and scared about what happened to you. I suggested you write down exactly what made you so sad and scared, did you do that? You know, I work with people of all ages, from little kids to the very elderly, and everyone reacts to tragedy differently. Tragedy always leads to a feeling of loss. It's a hole that feels funny, right? Yeah, so if you could process those feelings, how do you think it would affect your fantasies? Would you keep them in the way they are?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_Play_Tape_9_7143,"(Audio Tape 9-7143) What are you doing? Oh, you like those? I do too. They smell so sweet, don't they?

No? <i>I work a lot.</> I know you do, maybe more than you should. More free time would do you good. Do you have a hobby? No? Perhaps we could find one for you, like a sport. No? Hmm...

Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00121a,(Freddy) Aw.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00190,(Freddy) Bright lights in the eyes cause us to briefly malfunction. I suppose a Fazerblaster or a Faz Cam could work.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00183,(Freddy) But here is another Party Pass I found. This should help you in your investigations.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00076,(Freddy) Can you see me?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00060,(Freddy) Chica loves pizza!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00172,"(Freddy) Chica, Roxy, Monty. Do not listen. Resist her!",

Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00167,"(Freddy) Come in, Gregory. Can you hear me?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00071,(Freddy) Consider it a second wind.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00030,"(Freddy) Correct. Fazer Blast, Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway: they are all accessible to S.T.A.F.F. - with high enough clearance of course. Guests are never allowed down here, but yours is a... special situation.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00103,(Freddy) Correct. It is just... If we separate for any reason- it is not safe for you down here. It is easy to get lost. You should get a utility map from the warehouse. It is on the other side of the stage lift.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00188,"(Freddy) Could you, uh... reattach my head?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00072,"(Freddy) Do not let them in. The security doors are equipped with electrical deterrents. If you see them banging on the doors, hit the appropriate button. The shock should stun them.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00052,"(Freddy) Do not panic. If we get separated again, you can always call me on your Fazwatch - as long as I have power - and I am able to reach you.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00058,(Freddy) Do not panic. Look for the Kitchen Security Office. If you upgrade your security access you should be able to open those doors.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091,"(Freddy) Do not panic. That office is now on lockdown. I can deactivate the alarm, but it will take some time.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00033,(Freddy) Do not panic. You should see an interface on the security desk. Activate it.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00033b,(Freddy) Do not panic. You should see an interface on the security desk. Hold on while I will make it accessible to you... there. You can now activate security protocols.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00023,"(Freddy) Do not worry Gregory. Even if we are spotted, you are safe with me. She would never suspect we are traveling together. However, we should still do our best to avoid her. If I am sent back to my room, we will never get to the Lobby before midnight.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00086,(Freddy) Do you see a set of controls?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00073,"(Freddy) Do you see the large vent in the floor? You are probably standing right on top of it. If I can reach the room under you, I should be able to force it open and let you out.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00003,(Freddy) Down where?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00117,(Freddy) Everything seems to be offline. The entire arcade has been shut down. I am afraid the doors to the atrium are locked as well. This is not standard procedure. You should look for the security office on the top floor.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00099,"(Freddy) Fazer Blast, Monty Golf, Roxy Raceway...just to name a few. I have marked all locked attractions on your Faz Map.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00147,"(Freddy) Finally, suggestion number five: Check your Fazwatch cameras for threats and hidden prize boxes. You already have access to the Lobby and Atrium security cameras. Visit other Security Offices to add new camera systems to your Fazwatch.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00080,"(Freddy) Follow me to the atrium. That is a program disk for the stage show. If you use it in the sound booth, you should be able to run a showtime program which will activate the lift.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00169,(Freddy) Get to the Fazer Blast booth. Use the overhead system.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00169b,(Freddy) Get to the Fazer Blast booth. Use the security desk.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00064,(Freddy) Get to the elevator. Find a safe path on your Fazwatch.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00093,(Freddy) Go to the back of the Prize Counter. The Fire Escape is in the VIP room.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00044,"(Freddy) Go upstairs. And do not worry, they cannot find you while we are together.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00158,(Freddy) Go upstairs. We need to head back to the Lobby.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00234,(Freddy) Good job! Take the repaired head back to Roxy Raceway.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00215,"(Freddy) Good job, superstar! You got the Fazerblaster, but you had to use your Party Pass. If you find the security office, I am sure you will find something that will help you.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00018,"(Freddy) Good job. Now, please come let me out.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00228,"(Freddy) Good job. You have found a driver assist head. I do not believe it will work in that condition. However, there is a S.T.A.F.F. repair station in the West Arcade. You will need a Dance Pass to access the West Arcade.",

Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00157,"(Freddy) Gregory, I do not know what you did, but the lights are out in the Daycare! You need to find the emergency backup generators and turn them on. They are in the play structures.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00054,"(Freddy) Gregory, I have identified two possible exit points. The main loading dock is located under the food court on the first floor. There is also a fire escape in the third floor Prize Counter. Check your Fazwatch. I will mark both locations on your Faz Map.",

Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00245,"(Freddy) Gregory, are you certain you have seen a dancing rabbit lady? I believe you if you say you have, but it is highly unlikely. I have not seen her and she does not sound like a character we have at the Pizzaplex.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00238,"(Freddy) Gregory, are you sure? Some would call this a point of no return.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00220,"(Freddy) Gregory, as soon as it is safe, return to Parts and Service. You have the spare parts necessary to begin an upgrade procedure.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00241,"(Freddy) Gregory, be careful. This elevator does not appear to follow any safety protocols. I do not think it can survive more than one trip.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00218,"(Freddy) Gregory, did you read that message? It said there is a bag of Monty Mystery Mix behind the Bowling alley. Chica goes coo coo for Monty Mystery Mix.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00235,"(Freddy) Gregory, good news! It is almost 6 o'clock. You will be safe now if you find an exit. But hurry! The Daycare Attendant is loose one last time.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00081,"(Freddy) Gregory, my systems are failing. Go to the sound booth on the third floor balcony. Run the performance program on that disk then meet me back on the stage. Please hurry. You do not have much time. It is almost the end of the hour. I will wait here.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00244,"(Freddy) Gregory, please. We should stick together.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00078,"(Freddy) Gregory, push the button!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00195,"(Freddy) Gregory, that Party Pass is very special. It will let you into Fazer Blast or Monty Golf. However, it can only be used once.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00100,"(Freddy) Gregory, those parts belong to my friends. I would never do anything to hurt them.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00178,"(Freddy) Gregory, you have a choice to make. The door is open and you can go. Or you can continue to investigate the secrets of the Pizzaplex. I feel there is something else going on besides Vanny.",

Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00121,(Freddy) Gregory. Check out these shirts. Which one do you like best?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00159,(Freddy) Gregory. I am too big to go through vents.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00205,"(Freddy) Gregory. I do not mean to be intrusive, but I read that message that you found in the security office. There may be a chance to stop Monty from hunting you.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00242,"(Freddy) Gregory. I have a bad feeling. I do not wish to go down there. If we do, do not expect to return. This is your decision. Are you ready?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00008,"(Freddy) Gregory. I will notify the main office. Huh, connection error. I cannot connect to the main network.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00233,"(Freddy) Gregory. The security system knows you are here and has locked you out. Reset the breakers and restore power to the West Arcade, then you can repair the S.T.A.F.F. bot head.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00106,"(Freddy) Gregory. This upgrade... It was Chica's. Please, be honest. How did you get it?",

Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00062,"(Freddy) I must warn you: when you enter an area where you do not have a locator map signal, I will be unable to reach your location. You can update your mini-map at a security office. Be safe.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00028,(Freddy) I said nothing. I will keep you safe. Let us go.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00004,(Freddy) I still do not see you.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00168,(Freddy) I still have a signal.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00135,(Freddy) I thought we were friends.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00037,(Freddy) I wonder what the free prize is?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00227,"(Freddy) I would love to drive with you, but I am too big.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00193b,"(Freddy) I'm going. I'm going.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091b,"(Freddy) If you feel you are in danger, close the doors but you can not keep them closed forever. There is limited power available during a lockdown. If you run out of power, the doors will no longer close. I suggest you only close the doors when absolutely necessary.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00066,"(Freddy) If you get this message, come to the Roxy Raceway entrance on the second floor. I piled up some boxes so you can hop over the construction fence and find me. Something is jamming my communications signal. Come to the Roxy Raceway...",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00214,"(Freddy) If you have not done so already, you should check the Fazer Blast Office.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00232,"(Freddy) If you see the DJ, say ""Hello."" He is such a nice fellow.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091a,"(Freddy) In the meantime, stay where you are. That noise is bound to draw attention. If you leave the office, you will be easier to find.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00107,(Freddy) Is she ok?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00111,(Freddy) Is she ok?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00055,(Freddy) It appears that you have no Faz Map. You should be able to obtain one from the greeter on the center balcony.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00097,(Freddy) It is a Freddy Fazbear PARTY PASS.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00223,"(Freddy) It is almost the end of the hour! Get to a recharge station, Gregory, before the Daycare Attendant comes!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00069,"(Freddy) It is down under the main stage. Normally, the stage lift takes me down there after every concert. That is really the only way I know how.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00056,(Freddy) It looks like you do not have security clearance to access the kitchen. Find the open vent near the salad bar to bypass security.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00079,(Freddy) Jump down!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00196,"(Freddy) Just give it to a party bot. They usually stay in front of the attractions collecting Party Passes. If you have one, it will let you in. I have marked both locations on your map.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00189,(Freddy) Just reconnect the wires and be careful. I am not quite myself at the moment.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00240,"(Freddy) Lead the way, superstar.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00112,(Freddy) Look for a security Office. There should be a map and a security badge.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00197,"(Freddy) Look for the Security Office in the back hallway. Since there is no flash photography allowed in Monty Golf, Faz Cams are often confiscated here. Mainly because they are only sold in Monty Golf. It is a very clever marketing plan.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00162,"(Freddy) Look out. It's Chica.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00243,"(Freddy) Look, that Save Spot is working. If anything happens we will return to this spot.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00206,(Freddy) Monty loves hanging out on the catwalks. You can find the entrance in Mazercise.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00219,"(Freddy) Monty's mystery mix. The mystery is the pizza flavoring.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00104,(Freddy) My arms are different. Where did you get these parts?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00128,"(Freddy) My finger doubles as a lighter. You know, for birthday candles. And Crème Brûlée.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00005,(Freddy) My stomach hatch? That place is reserved for oversized birthday cakes and piñatas! It is not a safe play area!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00152,(Freddy) Need a hand?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00048,"(Freddy) No, I did not. There is no rabbit at the Mega Pizzaplex... Not anymore.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00025a,"(Freddy) No, I feel that something is wrong. I am taking you to the first aid station.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00123,(Freddy) No. I can not exit outside of this facility.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00174,(Freddy) No. Stop. No. Please.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00225,"(Freddy) Now that I have been upgraded, I should be able to access the Roxy Raceway. I have not been there for a very long time, but perhaps you can find some clues on how to deal with Roxy while you are there.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00026,"(Freddy) Officer Vanessa, I do not know how I got here.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00017,"(Freddy) Oh? You are going to need a Photo Pass to open the door. Apologies, I assumed you had one already... Well, you should be able to find one at a convenience counter.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00128a,(Freddy) Oops,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00142,"(Freddy) Otherwise, I have compiled a list of 5 suggestions to help you through the night.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00075,(Freddy) Over here!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00119,"(Freddy) Perhaps if you adjusted the heat in the boiler room, you could melt it. The boiler room is down in the utilidors. I will mark it on your map. However, I do not recommend you go there.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00039,"(Freddy) Perhaps there is a way to hack it back out. Try Glamrock Gifts. They have lots of trinkets, knickknacks, and doodads.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00173,(Freddy) Please. you do not want to do this.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00194,"(Freddy) Quick, find a recharge station. You should be able to see their locations on the map.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00077,(Freddy) Quickly! Open the door.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00083,(Freddy) Quickly. Get to the recharge station! Follow me.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00085,(Freddy) Routine maintenance. I am functioning much more better... now. Hm. Grammar function error... Perhaps I am still not at peak performance.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00007,(Freddy) Scanning complete. How odd. Your guest profile is unknown to me. Who are you?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00212,"(Freddy) Shame on you, Gregory. We cannot enter together. That would be cheating. I am programmed not to cheat.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00001,(Freddy) Showtime already?! I am experiencing a malfunction. The recharge cycle is not complete.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00163,(Freddy) Shut the doors!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00209,(Freddy) So. There is a vent in this maze that leads to the Monty Golf catwalks. I believe there is a control panel for the maze around here somewhere.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00087b,(Freddy) Something is not right. Someone must have changed the permissions. You are going to need a much higher security level to get out that way. Come back to me right away.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00160,(Freddy) Stop him...,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00146,(Freddy) Suggestion number four; You need to hide in a recharge station at the end of every hour. I will meet you there. You can also call me from your Fazwatch at any time to help... as long as I can find you and have power remaining.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00143,(Freddy) Suggestion number one; Look for prize boxes that have been hidden throughout the building. They should have helpful items to get you through the night.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00145,(Freddy) Suggestion number three; You must stay hidden and keep moving until the Lobby doors open at 6:00am.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00144,"(Freddy) Suggestion number two; If you find a party pass, give it to the ""Party Staff"" to access the attractions after hours.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00136,(Freddy) Superstar...,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00012,(Freddy) Take this. It is a novelty Freddy Fazwatch.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00148,"(Freddy) Thank you for taking the time to listen, Gregory. I wish you luck. The security doors will open in 3... 2... 1...",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00198,"(Freddy) That is a Faz Cam. If you are in trouble, use the camera flash to stun the other animatronics. Keep in mind that it will not work on Monty, due to his sunglasses.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00047,(Freddy) That is a fountain. A fountain is a decorative reservoir used for discharging water.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00108,"(Freddy) That is a relief. With this new voice box, I should be able to make a vocal pitch that will stun animatronics.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00041,(Freddy) That is great news! I will meet you in the daycare. The entrance is on the second floor balcony.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00184,(Freddy) That is great news. He can be returned to his parents.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00114,(Freddy) That is not possible. You must be mistaken. An Endo cannot function without its shell.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00010,(Freddy) That is the security guard. She can help!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00237,(Freddy) That was not me. That was a recording. I want to make sure you are not confused.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00156,(Freddy) The Atrium is locked. You will need to upgrade your ticket to get inside. Find the upgrade machine in Customer Service.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00143a,(Freddy) The Freddy Fazbear mega Pizzaplex deluxe lock-in birthday scavenger hunt package is normally reserved for special birthday kids. We will make an exception in your case... seeing as how you are not the birthday boy.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00091c,(Freddy) The cameras on your Fazwatch should help.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00164,(Freddy) The doors will not hold her.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00203,(Freddy) The security office is nearby. You might want to look around the office and see if there is a way to stop Monty from hunting you.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00179,"(Freddy) There is also something strange happening in Fazer Blast. I do not know what it is, but I can take you there if you wish to investigate.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00016,(Freddy) There is nothing to be scared of. You can do it.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00021,"(Freddy) There is still time, but we must hurry. If I am spotted, I will certainly be taken back to my room. I will escort you to the main exit through the utility tunnels. It is the safest path.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00101,(Freddy) There must be a good explanation. They are not capable of hurting a guest. None of us are! It would go against our programming.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00120,"(Freddy) There must be a problem with the main generator. Until power has been restored, I am afraid it will remain dark. Many doors will not function properly. Your Fazwatch should still work, though. I have marked the location of the generator on your map.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00067,(Freddy) There you are! I was so worried. I waited and waited for you. I missed the hourly recharge and have been trying to get down to Parts and Service. I think something is wrong.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00006,(Freddy) There you are.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00110,"(Freddy) These are Roxy's eyes?!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00235b,(Freddy) These eyes are amazing! There are wondrous colors and objects I never knew existed. Nothing can hide from me now!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00037a,(Freddy) These turnstiles require a Complimentary Pizzaplex Entry Pass. There should be one located near the main entrance.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00090,(Freddy) They are... required safety measures due to past issues. Look for another way in.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00095,"(Freddy) This is the Parts and Service center. When any of the band members have technical problems, we are sent here for maintenance. We also receive software upgrades... when our behaviors need correction.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00222,"(Freddy) This requires Chica's voice to activate.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00113,(Freddy) Those are Endoskeletons.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00087,(Freddy) Those are the loading dock controls.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00035,"(Freddy) Those boxes on your mini-map are nearby security cameras. When movement is detected by the camera's motion sensors, you should see red alert icons. Switch between the cameras to find a safe path out of the office and to the main lobby.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00040,(Freddy) Try that magnet you found.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00040a,(Freddy) Try that terrible magnet you found.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00170,(Freddy) Turn them against VANNY.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00069a,(Freddy) Use that door behind me. It will take you to the rehearsal room on the other side of the building. Look for a Backstage Pass then find a way to turn on the lift.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00084,(Freddy) Use the console to let me out.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00192,"(Freddy) Use the service elevators at the back of the room. They go up to Rockstar Row. It looks like they are all out of order except for Roxy's.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00186,"(Freddy) Vanessa, all the Fazwatches sound like me. It is the default voice option.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00187,"(Freddy) Vanessa, do not leave me like this!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00150,(Freddy) WHOAAAH!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00149,(Freddy) Wanna join our band?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00165b,(Freddy) Watch the vents!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00019,"(Freddy) Way to go, superstar! I knew you could do it.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00045,"(Freddy) We are almost out of time. We need to get to a recharge station immediately. Every hour the power is diverted to the recharge stations. When that happens the lights go out, and when <i>that</> happens the Daycare attendant is free to roam the building. It <i>will</> find you.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00029,(Freddy) We are now under the Pizzaplex. These utility tunnels connect all the attractions.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00053,(Freddy) We should get moving. You can access the main atrium with your new security badge.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00015,"(Freddy) Well done, Gregory. There is an open air vent inside the maintenance room. You will have to climb through the ventilation system and release me from the outside.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00088,"(Freddy) Well done, Gregory. You are in the East Arcade. You should be able to get to the Prize Counter through the security office. Look for the door with a security badge symbol on it.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00032,"(Freddy) Well done, Gregory. You found a security office. You should be quite safe here. The doors were designed to keep our highly-trained security staff safe in the event of an emergency. As long as the doors stay closed, which they will, as long as there is ample power...",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00213,"(Freddy) Well done, superstar! You won the Fazerblaster. Now, go collect your prize from the Superstar Lounge.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00154,"(Freddy) Well done, superstar. You have accessed the Lobby. Unfortunately, that complimentary entry ticket does not allow you to enter the pizzeria.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00193,(Freddy) Well done.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00057,(Freddy) Well done. You are near the Fizzy Faz syrup vats. You should be able to find your way to the Main Kitchen from here.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00217,(Freddy) What amazing luck. You got an annual Bonnie Bowl unlimited pass. Free bowling for a whole year! Mega Pizzaplex entry not included. Shoe and ball rental fees still apply.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00131,"(Freddy) Whatever it is, do not let it find you.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00102,(Freddy) Where are you going?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00133,(Freddy) Where are you going?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00138,(Freddy) Where are you?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00002,(Freddy) Who said that?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00009,(Freddy) Who? Who is looking for you? Your mother?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00139,(Freddy) Why do you hide?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00011,(Freddy) Why not?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00201,"(Freddy) Why, though?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00124,"(Freddy) Without a recharge station, my systems would shut down within an hour. It is a safety precaution. It is my design. This is where I must stay. Do not return. It will never be safe. I will miss you.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00182,(Freddy) Yes! Come. Let us end this!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00125,(Freddy) Yes. I am afraid that is correct.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00171,(Freddy) You are my Superstar...,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00239,(Freddy) You are staying? I am glad. Here. I found this Party Pass. There are areas we have not investigated.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00155,(Freddy) You can find an upgrade machine in Customer Service.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00247,(Freddy) You can no longer hide from me. I have new eyes.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00180,"(Freddy) You can still return here and leave later, if you have second thoughts.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00191,"(Freddy) You can win a Fazerblaster in Fazer Blast. Faz Cams are often confiscated in Monty Golf, but you will need a Party Pass to open one of those attractions. Chica normally gives them out for birthdays. Check her greenroom in Rockstar Row. You may find one there.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00129,"(Freddy) You found a Security Badge. For every badge you carry, your security access increases. It is an odd system which would be easy to exploit. It seems like an untrustworthy person could take advantage of such an obvious security weakness, but I highly doubt anyone would be that dishonest?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00063,"(Freddy) You found the Fire Escape. Unfortunately, I do not think there is a way to reach it without becoming a VIP. It is not a very good emergency system. You are lucky there is not a fire. I have lodged a formal complaint.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00208,(Freddy) You found the Mazercise ticket! Now you can enter Mazercise.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00207,(Freddy) You need to find a Mazercise ticket to get into Mazercise. Check the area.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00141,"(Freddy) You seem impatient. Do not worry about the security door. It will remain closed as long as there is power left in this zone's emergency generator. However, if you wish to leave this office, press the flashing button on the security console. It will open the security doors so you may leave...",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00127,(Freddy) You sure collected a lot of toys. Perhaps we can do something to stop whatever is going on here...,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00034,(Freddy) Your Fazwatch is now connected to the security camera system. Check the map on your Fazwatch.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_FREDDY_00025,(Freddy) Your arm is cut badly. I will take you to a first aid station.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00096a,(Gregory) ...that one. I guess.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00011,(Gregory) Ah! My arm.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00154,"(Gregory) Alright Roxy, here I come.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00119,(Gregory) Attention. Command voice override.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00105,"(Gregory) C'mon. Where are you?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00121,(Gregory) Dismantle Vanny. Dismantle Vanny.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00015,"(Gregory) Don't worry about it. I'm fine.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00015a,"(Gregory) Don't worry about it. I'm fine.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00080,(Gregory) Exactly like he did.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00050,(Gregory) Freddy said I can find a Backstage Pass around here somewhere...,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00159,"(Gregory) Freddy said I should go downstairs to the kitchen, or upstairs through El Chip's to the fire escape.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00159b,"(Gregory) Freddy said I should go downstairs to the kitchen, or upstairs to the Prize Counter.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00061,(Gregory) Freddy said the booth is on the third floor.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00067,(Gregory) Freddy!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00046,(Gregory) Freddy! Are you ok?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00140,(Gregory) Freddy! I found the party pass!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00098,"(Gregory) Freddy! It's open! Let's go!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00058,(Gregory) Freddy! You saved me!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00127,"(Gregory) Freddy's in there. I have to get him out.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00036,"(Gregory) Freddy, Are you there? I'm trapped! Chica found me and there's only one security door!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00035,"(Gregory) Freddy, I can't open any of these doors. I think I am stuck in here.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00025,"(Gregory) Freddy, I found the free gift!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00056,"(Gregory) Freddy, I see Roxy and Monty on the cameras. They're both coming to the office!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00127a,"(Gregory) Freddy, can you hear me?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00076,"(Gregory) Freddy, check out these pictures. Chica has some sort of special voice box, Roxy has new eyes, and Monty was given better claws. We have to get these! We could upgrade you!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00040a,"(Gregory) Freddy, everything's locked! I can't get out of here!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00044,"(Gregory) Freddy, help! That rabbit lady found me!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00100,"(Gregory) Freddy, if I leave now, nothing will change, will it? There will be more disappearances.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00070,"(Gregory) Freddy, it's not opening.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00118,"(Gregory) Freddy, no!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00117,"(Gregory) Freddy, that rabbit lady's in a secret room above Fazer Blast. It looks like a hideout. I think her name is ""Vanny"".",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00040,"(Gregory) Freddy, the doors are all locked! I can't get out of here!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00021,"(Gregory) Freddy, the power is only at 15% and they're pounding on the door! How am I going to get out of here?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00132,"(Gregory) Freddy, there's something here.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00103,"(Gregory) Freddy. I don't think I'm alone in here...",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00104,(Gregory) Freddy. I need your help.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00143,"(Gregory) Freddy. It's cold in here.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00094,"(Gregory) Freddy. It's freezing in here...",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00074,"(Gregory) Freddy? Freddy, are you there?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00102,(Gregory) Freddy? Freddy? Are you ok?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00034,"(Gregory) Good news? Five hours? I'm not gonna last five minutes!",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00136,(Gregory) Got it! I can open Parts and Service now.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00051,(Gregory) Got it! Now I should be able to find the lift controls.,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00142,(Gregory) Great. How do I use it?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00124,(Gregory) He? What is that thing?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00091,(Gregory) Hey! Over here!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00128,"(Gregory) Hmm. It's a map of the utility tunnels. There's a security office nearby. If I can find another Security Badge, I can get into Parts and Service.",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00092,(Gregory) Hot! Too hot!,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00083,(Gregory) How are your new eyes?,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00093,(Gregory) Huh. I guess these buttons do something to the maze...,
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00158,"(Gregory) Huh. I wonder what's up there?",
Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00060,(Gregory) I better avoid that spotlight.,

Loc_Subtitles/Loc_Subtitle_GREGORY_00088,(Gregory) So. This is what you look like inside? Creepy. I like you better with your shell on.,

I come in </>\_00_32<i>and sit and my desk and do my work.</> Yes, yes of \_00_36course you do. Your performance reviews are good, \_00_40but a routine check of your online history has \_00_44revealed that you've spent quite a bit of time \_00_47with someone in an encrypted conversation. We \_00_51have transcripts and I've read them, but it's not \_00_55clear what you're talking about in these \_00_58conversations. I can't make sense of it. You must \_01_02be getting something from these that I'm not \_01_05getting, right? Who are you talking to in these? \_01_09<i>No one!

How do you spend all the time you \_00_11have? Nothing? Well... how do you feel about \_00_14sports? You like sports? Yeah? No? Oh, I get it. \_00_18You like to watch them, but not play them. You \_00_22like being inside, don't you? I get that. Lots of \_00_26weird stuff outdoors, isn't there? Yeah, I \_00_29understand. Well, I hate to do this right off the \_00_33bat, but I've been directed to ask you about \_00_36this. Apparently, I'm the fourth therapist you've \_00_40had, and apparently all three of your former \_00_44therapists have gone missing. Or, two of them are \_00_47missing. I don't want to scare you, but I have to \_00_51tell you that one of them was found dead. That \_00_55doesn't seem to upset you. Well then, I guess \_00_59I'll go ahead and tell you that the woman's body \_01_02was pretty messed up. It looked like it was \_01_06mangled by machinery. That doesn't bother you \_01_09either? Hmm... it's all pretty strange, I think. \_01_13I'm not clear on the circumstances. Apparently, \_01_17the police don't have any evidence. How does all \_01_21of this make you feel?

Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_Play_Tape_14_4677,"(Audio Tape 14-4677) \_00_00Do you know a place called Freddy Fazbear's Mega \_00_03Pizzaplex? I'll take your silence as a yes. And \_00_06besides, I know you know it. Because the \_00_09technicians who work for Pizzaplex know you. Or \_00_12rather, I guess it would be better to say that \_00_16they think they do. They report that they have \_00_19caught you on camera, or at least it appears to \_00_22be you. Nothing to say about that? Well, the \_00_25techs are convinced that you've hacked into their \_00_29system many times. Although, I'll admit I don't \_00_32see any proof here. Seems like they have more of \_00_35a gut feeling than fact. But apparently the hacks \_00_39are causing all kinds of problems. Hmm, you get a \_00_42kick out of that? The idea of techs running \_00_45around like chickens with their heads cut off? \_00_48Yeah, that's a funny image, isn't it? But \_00_51seriously, I have to say that I think it's weird \_00_55that you'd spend so much time in such a busy, \_00_58social place. You seem like more of a loner to \_01_01me. Lots of time by yourself instead of with \_01_04friends. Lots of time talking to yourself, right? \_01_08Is it the electronics you like? I saw in your \_01_11file that you've developed software programs that \_01_14talk to you and repeat phrases, right? The \_01_17program asks you questions and prompts you for \_01_21responses. It's kind of like your own self \_01_23therapy, isn't it? Another way of talking to \_01_27yourself to work things out, right? When I saw \_01_30some of your recent encrypted conversation logs, \_01_33that's what I thought I was looking at. It felt \_01_36like I was watching someone go back and forth in \_01_40their own head, but the techs found something \_01_43that's different than that. When I read what they \_01_46found, at first, I thought I was looking at more \_01_50examples of you just talking with yourself, then \_01_53I realized it was different. When I study this, \_01_57it sounds like there is someone else responding \_02_00to you. Who is it?",
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_Play_Tape_15_4678,"(Audio Tape 15-4678) \_00_00I saw some ink blot test results in your file. I \_00_05like ink blot tests. You wanna do one? Yes? Ok. \_00_10How about this one? What do you see? What? You \_00_14wanna hold it? Ok. You think it's a mask? It \_00_19reminds you of a mask? Like a disguise? Yeah, I \_00_24can see that. You like the idea of being \_00_28disguised? Disguises let you be sort of \_00_32invisible, don't they? You can get away with \_00_37almost anything when you're invisible, can't you? \_00_42(chuckles). Yeah? You like that idea, huh? Well \_00_47ok, moving on. I have another report we need to \_00_52talk about. Apparently, the techs were reviewing \_00_57communications going in and out of this building \_01_02and they came across some interesting things. \_01_07They say you're in communication with someone... \_01_12or maybe something. Pretty strange. What do you \_01_17think about that? Nothing? Well, the techs say it \_01_22looked to them like it was an attempt to \_01_26manipulate you, or maybe to lure you somewhere. \_01_31There, that's better. On this side of the desk, I \_01_36can see your eyes. The thing is, when I read the \_01_42communications, I get something different out of \_01_47them. I don't think you're being manipulated \_01_51here. I think you're the one doing the \_01_55manipulating. No comment, huh? Ok... then how \_02_00about this? I have this still shot the techs \_02_05pulled from the security footage that recorded \_02_10you in the Pizzaplex. That's you, isn't it? I \_02_14know this image is distorted, but I think it \_02_19looks like you. And you're not alone here. You're \_02_24talking to someone, or something, it's hard to \_02_29tell. What are those things? They almost look \_02_34like rabbit ears. What? You find that amusing? \_02_39Well, I guess it is.",
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_Play_Tape_16_4679,"(Audio Tape 16-4679) \_00_00I got another message from the techs at the \_00_03Pizzaplex. I'm afraid it's about you again. The \_00_07techs have been struggling to fix some serious \_00_11glitches with the robots. I'm not sure what \_00_14exactly is wrong except that it's making the \_00_18robots more eerie than entertaining. You like \_00_21that? Eerie instead of entertaining? Thanks, but \_00_25it's really not that funny. Apparently, the \_00_29glitch extended beyond the robots. It went system \_00_33wide. It began infecting all the machines and \_00_37when the techs traced the glitch back to its \_00_40origin it led them to you. And I'm not going to \_00_44pretend to understand everything I'm reading \_00_48here, but what I get is that the system wide \_00_51glitch was like a cascade that was broadcasting a \_00_55very dangerous message. While the techs were \_00_59trying to reprogram the system to remove the \_01_02glitch, the source of the glitch shifted. You'll \_01_06have to excuse me, I'm not all that familiar with \_01_10computer programming so I might get this wrong, \_01_14but what I understand is that the glitch stopped \_01_18being a glitch and turned into an intentional set \_01_22of sub-routines that were aimed at creating the \_01_26same thing the glitch created. Those sub-routines \_01_30seem to have come from you. Can you explain that? \_01_34Listen, I'm on your side here. Our sessions are \_01_38just between you and me. The techs can't prove \_01_41what they think, so you're not in trouble. I just \_01_45thought you could tell me what you're trying to \_01_49do. Maybe if we could get to the bottom of that \_01_53it could help you. What do you think? Still not \_01_57talking? Alright, well then let's do this. Why \_02_01don't we talk about the research I did in your \_02_05past, shall we? Some therapists think they should \_02_09only focus on information they get from their \_02_12clients, but some therapists, like me, think it's \_02_16helpful to find out about clients from other \_02_20sources. Wanna guess what I found out when I \_02_23looked into the tragedy of your past? All that \_02_27stuff about your parents? You aren't even gonna \_02_31look at me? Fine, you can look at the floor all \_02_35you want, but it won't change the fact that none \_02_39of what you said in your file about your parents \_02_43was true. The truth is, you had great parents, a \_02_47great childhood. Why did you lie? Look at me. \_02_50Tell me why you lied. You - (clears throat) Well, \_02_54I can understand why you might feel angry about \_02_58the way I just confronted you. Why don't we come \_03_02back to this another day?

The fact that you're still doing \_00_23something obviously not work related on the job \_00_27is disturbing enough, but what bothers me about \_00_30what I read is that the messages you're getting \_00_34seem very manipulative in nature.

Oh, sorry, you don't know \_00_44what that means, do you? What I mean is that the \_00_48way you told the story is more like you were \_00_51reading something from a book than you were \_00_54talking about your own past.

Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00070,(Freddy) \_00_00Gregory? What did you do? Something happened. I \_00_04can communicate again. I think you fixed my \_00_08signal. Thank you.,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00229,(Freddy) \_00_00Have you checked the party garages? The raceway \_00_03was closed very abruptly prior to the new \_00_06construction. Guests tend to leave things behind \_00_09during emergency situations.,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00161,(Freddy) \_00_00He is trying to take control of me. I do not \_00_04think I can fight it for long.,

Grab a jumbo slice of pepperoni \_00_07and top it off with an ice cold Fizzy Faz. Then \_00_10enjoy our super games and attractions.

You should be able to \_00_07escape when the security doors reopen at 6:00am. \_00_10Until then, keep moving and try not to draw \_00_14attention to yourself. If there is another way \_00_17out, I will help you find it. I promise.",
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00059,(Freddy) \_00_00How unfortunate. But I have good news: It looks \_00_03like you can access the Fazbear online pizza \_00_06delivery system through that console!,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00089,"(Freddy) \_00_00How unfortunate. Head past the Superstar-cade \_00_02wall, to the back of the arcade. There is a roll \_00_06up door at the very back which leads to the Prize \_00_09Counter.",

Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00109,(Freddy) \_00_00I am having a hard time adjusting. You look \_00_03different to me. I can see movement through the \_00_07walls.,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00049,(Freddy) \_00_00I am not.,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00013,(Freddy) \_00_00I am sending you an encoded message.,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00226,(Freddy) \_00_00I am so sorry. It appears you are not tall enough \_00_03to ride the karts alone. You will need a working \_00_07driver assist bot in order to use this kart.,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00022,"(Freddy) \_00_00I am sorry Gregory. I would love to do a tour, \_00_03but it is closing time and this door is locked. \_00_06Look for a door with my icon on it.",
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00140,"(Freddy) \_00_00I am sorry Gregory. You did not make it out in \_00_00time. That is unfortunate. The main entrance will \_00_00not open again until 6 am. Think of it as a \_00_01slumber party. Or a ""Lock-In"". That is a party \_00_01where you lock all the children in a building \_00_01then have a slumber party. No one is allowed to \_00_02enter or leave. It is fun.

Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00126,(Freddy) \_00_00I cannot believe you were able to collect enough \_00_01toys to become a VIP.,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00200,(Freddy) \_00_00I cannot see!,
Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00221,"(Freddy) \_00_00I could open this gate if I had Monty's claws.",

Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00098,(Freddy) \_00_00I do not know. I was holding it when I rebooted. \_00_00You can use it to open the gates to one of the \_00_01many attractions. But it can only be used once. \_00_01You will have to find additional Party Passes to \_00_02access the other attractions.,

Loc_Subtitles_Timestamp/Loc_Subtitle_TimeStamp_FREDDY_00198,"(Freddy) \_00_00That is a Faz Cam. If you are in trouble, use the \_00_03camera flash to stun the other animatronics. Keep \_00_06in mind that it will not work on Monty, due to \_00_09his sunglasses.",
